# Cline Rules for rni34.github.io Resume Repository

## Project Overview
This is a personal resume website built with Next.js and deployed to GitHub Pages. The site showcases professional experience, technical skills, awards, and content contributions for Ryo Nishikawa, a Cloud Support Engineer (DevOps) at AWS.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## Code Style Guidelines

### React/TypeScript
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Prefer arrow functions for component definitions
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling

### File Organization
- Main resume content: `react-resume/app/page.tsx`
- Global styles: `react-resume/app/globals.css`
- Public assets: `react-resume/public/`
- Build output: Root directory (for GitHub Pages)

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. Edit files in the `react-resume/` directory
2. Test locally if needed with `npm run dev` in the react-resume directory
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages
4. Push to master branch - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy

### Deployment Pipeline
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy-nextjs.yml`
- **Trigger**: Push to master branch
- **Process**: Builds Next.js app and deploys static export to GitHub Pages
- **URL**: https://rni34.github.io/

## Content Guidelines

### Resume Structure
The resume follows this hierarchy:
1. **Header**: Name, title, contact information, photo
2. **About**: Professional summary
3. **Work Experience**: Chronological work history with bullet points
4. **Technical Skills**: Categorized by domain (Cloud, DevOps, Programming, Databases)
5. **Sidebar**: Education, Awards, Content, Languages, Interests

### Content Updates
- Keep professional tone and technical accuracy
- Use action verbs for accomplishments
- Quantify achievements where possible
- Maintain consistent formatting across sections
- Ensure all links are functional and open in new tabs

### AWS/DevOps Focus
- Emphasize AWS services expertise (CloudFormation, CDK, etc.)
- Highlight Infrastructure as Code (IaC) experience
- Showcase automation and CI/CD achievements
- Include relevant certifications and SME status

## Git Commit Messages
- Use conventional commit format: `type: description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `chore`
- Examples:
  - `feat: add new certification to awards section`
  - `fix: correct typo in work experience`
  - `docs: update README with deployment instructions`
  - `chore: update dependencies`

## Testing Checklist
Before committing changes:
- [ ] Verify all content is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Check that all links work correctly
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] Confirm no TypeScript/linting errors
- [ ] Test that images load properly
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions workflow passes

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Content
- **New job/experience**: Add to Work Experience section with consistent formatting
- **New skill**: Add to appropriate Technical Skills category
- **New award**: Add to Awards section in sidebar
- **New content/video**: Add to Content section with clickable link

### Updating Information
- **Contact details**: Update in Header section
- **Job description**: Modify bullet points in relevant experience entry
- **Skills**: Add/remove from Technical Skills categories

## Best Practices
- Always preview changes locally when possible
- Keep the design clean and professional
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Optimize images for web (compress before adding)
- Keep the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## Deployment Notes
- The site is built as a static export (`output: 'export'` in next.config.ts)
- All paths must be relative for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Images should be in the `public/` directory
- The build process copies output to root directory for GitHub Pages

## MCP Servers Available
This project has access to several MCP servers that can help with development:
- **GitHub MCP**: For checking workflows, issues, and repository management
- **Playwright**: For testing the live website
- **Google Search**: For research and finding resources
